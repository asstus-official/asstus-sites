# Sustainable Production Alliance (SPA) Carbon Emissions Report Summary (2021)

This report, released by the **Sustainable Production Alliance (SPA)** in March 2021, uses production data collected between 2016 and 2019 to establish an industry baseline for carbon emissions in film and television. The data was gathered using the Production Environmental Accounting Report (PEAR) tool.

## 1. Major Sources of Emissions

For feature film productions, **fuel consumption** is the single largest contributor to the overall carbon footprint.

| Emissions Source (Tentpole Films) | Percentage of Total Carbon Footprint | GHG Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fuel Consumption** | Nearly **48%** | Scope 1 (Direct) |
| **Air Travel** | ~24% | Scope 3 (Value Chain) |
| **Utilities** (e.g., purchased electricity) | ~22% | Scope 2 (Indirect) |
| **Accommodations/Housing** | 6% | Scope 3 (Value Chain) |

## 2. Production Carbon Footprint Averages

The figures represent the average total carbon footprint, measured in **metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)**.

### Feature Films

| Production Type | Average Carbon Footprint (Metric Tons CO2e) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tentpole Films** | **3,370** |
| Large Films | 1,081 |
| Medium Films | 769 |
| Small Films | 391 |

***Note:*** *A Tentpole Film averages approximately **33 metric tons of CO2e per shooting day**.*

### Television Series (Per Episode)

| Production Type | Average Carbon Footprint (Metric Tons CO2e per Episode) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1-hour Scripted Drama** | **77** |
| 1/2 hour Scripted Single-Camera| 26 |
| Unscripted Shows | 13 |
