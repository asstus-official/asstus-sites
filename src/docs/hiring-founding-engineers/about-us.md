## Founding Engineers: What in the Actual Heck Do They Do? 🦄

For many startup founders, especially the non-technical ones who still think **"cloud"** is just a fluffy thing in the sky, the role of a **Founding Engineer** is a glorious, confusing enigma. What is this mythical creature's job description? What outrageous things are we supposed to expect? And, most importantly, how much gold do we have to pay them? 💰

We're here to answer all your most **aggressively burning questions** about these engineering superheroes and give you the harsh, yet valuable, truth for your wild, early-stage SaaS safari. 🦒

### What in the World is a Founding Engineer? 🧙‍♂️

A founding engineer is one of the first few poor souls dragged into the whirlwind of a tech startup. They play a **crucial, sanity-testing role** in shaping the company's technological doom or glory, working like a caffeinated maniac to design, build, and maintain the company's product from a cold, hard tech standpoint.

Unlike the company’s founders themselves (who are often just excellent talkers), Founding Engineers typically get **zero ownership** at inception but are later tossed some **"substantial" equity** and often receive a salary so high it might make the founders weep into their ramen. 😭

The job of a Founding Engineer is a **unique opportunity** to shape a company from the ground up—or accidentally set it on fire. 🔥

### What is Their Actual Job Description? (Hint: Everything) 🤯

Early-stage SaaS startups don't have the luxury of specialists; they need generalist, **multiple-hat-wearing engineers** who can survive a nuclear winter and thrive in a market where **90%** of all startups fail, and **25%** have the decency to call it quits in their first year. ⚰️

A founding engineer’s main job is to take **ownership of literally everything** and furiously build out an **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product, or as we like to call it, the **"Miraculously Vaporizing Product"**). They tend to juggle the following:

* **Building the core product:** Translating the founder's vague, hand-wavy vision into a functional solution, often starting with a crayon sketch on a napkin.
* **Defining the tech stack:** Picking the programming languages and tools that will either power future growth or cause a decade of technical debt. 🤦
* **Writing clean, efficient code:** They write the foundational code future engineers will complain about for years.
* **Build a team:** Forming a team of engineers who can build the company’s vision... after they've done all the hard work themselves.

Although a Founding Engineer’s job is predominantly consumed by the **soul-crushing task of coding**, they can sometimes find themselves performing truly bizarre tasks for the founders, like speaking to annoyed customers or conducting deep-dive market research (i.e., **Googling things**).

An early-stage startup is an organizational vacuum—they won’t always have a Product Manager or Customer Success Manager, so **everyone**, including the poor Founding Engineer, will pitch in to cover those activities (i.e., they’ll be forced to put on a suit and **pretend to like people**).

### What Traits Should I Look For? (Spoiler: A Robot) 🤖

There are many traits to look for in a Founding Engineer; it extends far beyond just knowing how to type.

A Founding Engineer should be able to perform a **wide, terrifying range** of other activities to help a startup grow during a phase where the founders have fewer options than a pigeon in a chess match and a budget that consists of lint and a dream.

A great FE hire should look something like this:

* **The Tech Know-How (i.e., the Sorcerer):** They know how to build MVPs **stupidly fast**. They’ve done it before and know what needs to be done without being babied.
* **A Believer in Your Vision (i.e., a Naïve Optimist):** They take a **genuine financial risk** when they join. They have to truly believe in your vision and see it as an opportunity, not just something they have to **"live with"** until the next recruiter calls. 📞
* **Go the Extra Mile (or 10) (i.e., a Workaholic):** An **unwritten rule** is you put in the hours—you know, the ones that ruin your sleep schedule. They must be ready for **evenings and weekends** at their computer if need be (i.e., they must have **no social life**).
* **Be Adaptable (i.e., a Shapeshifter):** They must be **able to adapt** to an ever-changing market and not be afraid to pivot (i.e., completely change the product they just spent three months building) or **learn something completely new** if push comes to shove. 🤯
